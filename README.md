# UK Wholesale Produce 2017-2022 
### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations
---
*This series gives the average wholesale prices of selected home-grown horticultural produce in England and Wales. These are averages of the most usual prices charged by wholesalers for selected home-grown fruit, vegetables and cut flowers at the wholesale markets in UK*

Actions Taken:
- The data was inspected, cleaned, and analyzed.
- Data visualizations were created using seaborn/matplotlib and Tableau

### Summary

The main take away from this analysis is that **much of profit in wholesale produce for this region is likely driven by sales of seasonal fruit**. Focusing optimization on this area is likely to pay the highest dividends. Further analysis with more data is needed.

* There may be other factors in the data driving a sluggish seasonal bump in vegetable prices that should be explored

* There may be room for growth in categories other than fruit that would lead to a similar seasonal bump.

### Recommendations:

**Ensure that operations are centered around making the most of fruit sales under the period May to October**. Use the 'off months' to prepare to maximize this potential and to also discover options for creating a some seasonal bump during the period November to April (diversifying operations if possible).

### This Tableau visualization shows a comparison of apple varieties.  Although unrelated to the core analysis, I found it interesting and could serve as a jumping off point for an analysis of produce varieties.
